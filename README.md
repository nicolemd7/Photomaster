## About
Photomaster aims to act as a one stop application that enables users to reduce clutter, efficiently organize and retrieve images, whilst also providing the user with the choice of beautifying images.


## Features:

- Tagging
  - After downloading the photomaster app the user will see all their photos in the gallery view. These images can be stored in under various tags.
  - These collections will be formed by creating tags for each image.
  - Once tags are generated, it is saved in the database along with the image. An album is created, which would then be displayed to the user.
  - The user can tag multiple images using these tags and each image can be assigned multiple tags
