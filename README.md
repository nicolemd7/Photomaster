## About
Photomaster aims to act as a one stop application that enables users to reduce clutter, efficiently organize and retrieve images, whilst also providing the user with the choice of beautifying images.


## Features:

- Tagging
  - After downloading the photomaster app the user will see all their photos in the gallery view. These images can be stored in under various tags.
  - These collections will be formed by creating tags for each image.
  - Once tags are generated, it is saved in the database along with the image. An album is created, which would then be displayed to the user.
  - The user can tag multiple images using these tags and each image can be assigned multiple tags

- Geolocation
  - The user will be shown a map which contains locations of various images taken, on clicking a location
the user will be shown the images taken at that location. The images' locations will be accessed using
either the coordinates available on the EXIF file or by means of metadata entered by the user

- Enhancements
  - Image selection
        - When you choose an image to edit, it will be highlighted and will then take over the screen, with three options to crop, feature select, and alter the image in the bottom bar.
